# WindowsTextExpander
It is a project, made with the help of AI(ChatGPT, claude etc). It is not complete yet. <br>
I didn't add any GU interface for this project and also didn't add any database for storing short form and long forms. <br>
It will work for only short form stores in the source code.

<br> <br>

For running this program your PC should have C++ compiler installed. <br>
And after compiling this code with the command 'g++ -o textexpander txtexpander.cpp -lgdi32', you have to run the exe file. <br>
After that you can  enjoy the program. <br>
